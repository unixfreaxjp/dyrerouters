Amount of up & alive routers actively proxy Dyre payload:
```
47
```

## Usage

Use the script logic like below to monitor infection per new payload :
```
# @unixfreaxjp #MalwareMustDie shared info. Ver 3.0 under WTFL license.
payload[0]='[payload1]';
payload[1]='[payload2]';
payload[b]='[payloadn]';

while read router
do
echo;
        for i in `seq 0 n`;
        do
          echo -n $router" " && echo -n ${payload[i]}" ";
          wget https://$router/${payload[i]};
          sleep 0;
        done
done
exit 0;
```
[RAW-LOG.TXT] generated is useful for many checks, contains data like:

## Useful tips

(1) Periodical infection can be analyzed by:compare Date to grep'/dev/null, like:
```
2015-08-27 00:32:21 URL:https://173.216.247.74/ar77.zip [434422/434422] -> "/dev/null" [1]
2015-08-27 00:32:30 URL:https://173.248.31.6/ar77.zip [434422/434422] -> "/dev/null" [1]
2015-08-27 00:32:45 URL:https://180.233.123.210/ar77.zip [434422/434422] -> "/dev/null" [1]
2015-08-27 00:32:58 URL:https://186.68.94.38/ar77.zip [434422/434422] -> "/dev/null" [1]
```
(2) A sample to grep to monitor the rogue certification cycle used:
```
cat [RAW-RESULT.TXT]|grep 'certificate'|sed s/'WARNING\: cannot verify '//|grep 'issued by'
```
   result is like:
```
103.230.226.59's certificate, issued by 'CN=ELA5dx5SgQaNbe9,O=ejkiHMo6KSzSz67gtQpEyJ,L=UhzlBJ2GWd9NwmXoBIBBsRDDy7FNW,ST=BA,C=UQ':

i.e. example of infectious routers in United States by grep result with '| US |'
